Three-Player Snooker Rules and Scoreboard App
=============================================

This project contains special snooker rule adaptation for three players, and a
scoreboard app Piste on Piste [*]_ for the rules.

The scoreboard app is a fairly simple single-page application written in
JavaScript and `Svelte`_. There's no internet connection required besides
loading the page. All state is stored in browser local storage only, and never
sent anywhere.

The `documentation`_, `rules`_, and the `scoreboard app`_ are continuously
deployed in GitHub Pages. Additionally, there's a `development version`_ of the
app built from current main branch.

Note from the Author
--------------------

While I am a professional programmer, this is purely a hobby project, if ever
there was one. I've never done anything in JavaScript or Svelte before. It's not
a pretty codebase. But I'm not sure I have much motivation to polish it either.

I'm also not much of a snooker player.
